## Introduction

Cancer research relies heavily on identifying biomarkers that can enhance our understanding of cancer progression, improve diagnostics, and help develop effective treatment strategies. Glioblastoma and gliomas, aggressive brain tumors with a poor prognosis, along with lung adenocarcinoma, a prevalent form of lung cancer, have prompted efforts to understand the molecular drivers of tumor growth, treatment resistance, and relapse.

In this project, we delve into the gene expression and methylation profiles of glioblastoma, gliomas, and lung adenocarcinoma. Glioblastomas are typically IDH-wildtype, which is linked to more aggressive disease behavior, while specific IDH statuses in gliomas provide unique insights into tumor subtypes and prognoses. For lung adenocarcinoma, which represents a substantial portion of lung cancer cases, uncovering genetic alterations and gene expression patterns can significantly impact targeted therapy approaches. Through differential gene expression, functional enrichment analysis, and machine learning, this study aims to identify potential biomarkers that could contribute to understanding and treating these cancers more effectively.

## Objectives

### Stage 2: Glioblastoma Gene Expression Analysis
- Generate heatmaps to visualize gene expression data, focusing on differentially expressed genes.
- Cluster genes and samples to detect co-expressed gene groups and potential biological interactions.
- Perform downstream functional enrichment analysis to identify pathways impacted by upregulated or downregulated genes.

### Stage 3: Lung Adenocarcinoma Gene Expression Analysis and Functional Enrichment
- Analyze gene expression patterns to identify differentially expressed genes specific to lung adenocarcinoma.
- Conduct pathway enrichment analysis to uncover biological processes and pathways most affected by gene expression changes.
- Utilize gene expression data to explore potential biomarkers for diagnostic or therapeutic development in lung adenocarcinoma.

### Stage 4: Glioma Methylation Data Analysis for IDH Status Classification
- Analyze DNA methylation data for gliomas, focusing on differentiating between wildtype and mutant IDH statuses.
- Use clustering techniques to classify glioma samples based on IDH methylation patterns.
- Apply machine learning models (e.g., KNN, Random Forest) for accurate classification and biomarker discovery, providing insights into glioma subtypes and potential treatment targets.
